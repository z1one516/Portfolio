## About :
In the supply chain management, it is important to place an appropriate amount of order to minimize the inventory cost and the loss of sales opportunity.  

## Data :
Provdied by a food company

## Result :
When compared to the conventional approach of using a 3-month moving average prediction, the final model showed an 11% higher accuracy rate difference.

## Feedback :
Overall the project seems to have been proceeded based on the deep  understanding of time series data such as creating derived variables with lagging, rolling and differencing. 

## What I learned :
Statistical knowledge applied to a model not only enhances the credibility of data analysis but also contributes to the improvement of model performance.
