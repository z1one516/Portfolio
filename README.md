According to the six degrees of separation, any person can be connected to any other person on the planet with less than five intermediaries. I believe that the product is one intermediate component that connects all people in the world. Fascinated by how product connects the world, I believe supply chain management can play various roles in the society.

The significance of data is highly valuable to both internal and external customers when optimizing distribution. Rather than regarding data as mere numbers, I seek meanings and stories from data in social context.

In terms of external customer, I have undertaken the following projects with the objective of improving the quality of service that can be provided.

## Project 1 - Customers Feedback on Overseas Online Shopping
* About :\
The first project I proceeded started with a question of what factor affects the customers' satisfaction the most when they are shopping online overseas. In Korea, there has been a sharp increase in the market size of Cross-Border E-commerce, which naturally led to an escalation of complaints received by Korea Consumer Agency. As the clothing was the product that the customer found the inconvenience the most, I conducted EDA of customers comments on men's T-shirt with a hypothesis that the difference of size caused the inconvenience.

* Data :\
11st amazon store > Fashion > Men's Clothing > Top \
https://amazon.11st.co.kr/amazon/category?dispCtgr3No=1150107

* Result :\
Size-mentioned negative comments were 1.8 times as many than positive comments and delivery-mentioned positive comments were twice as many than negative comments.

* Feedback :\
Some of women's clothing were mixed in the product list. If the data is preprocessed more thoroughly, the accuracy of the review will be higher.

* What I learned :\
Going through the pre step of data analysis, I found that data analysis needs to have a purpose that gives an insight to improve the status or solve the problem. Additionally, as I used NLTK and Sentiment Dictionary to deal with language data, I found that it is important to try new skills that I have not tried.
